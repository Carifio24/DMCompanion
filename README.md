# DM Companion

This repository contains the code (and built binaries) for DM Companion, a desktop program intended as a reference for a D&D 5e Dungeon Master. The program, which is still a work in progress, currently consists of a spellbook and an (incomplete) monster manual.

## Features

Current features include:

### Spellbook
* Complete spell lists from the Player's Handbook, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide
* Two-level sorting
* Filter spells by class
* Filter spells by sourcebook
* Text search
* Keep a list of favorite spells (stored in the file Favorites.txt, located in the same directory as the program)

### Monster Manual
